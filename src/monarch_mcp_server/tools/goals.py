# Monarch disables GraphQL introspection for non-admin users and masks unknown
# field errors as a generic "Something went wrong", so this selection set was
# established field-by-field against the live API, then reconciled against the
# web app's own GoalSummaryFields fragment. Note the balance field is
# `currentBalance`, not `currentAmount`, and progress is served directly as a
# 0..1 fraction rather than being computed client-side.
#
# There are TWO goal collections. `savingsGoals` is the current one and matches
# what the app shows. `goalsV2` is the superseded collection: on a real account
# every goalsV2 record carried an identical archivedAt to the microsecond (the
# migration timestamp) while the same goals showed as active in the app, and
# their targets were stale -- a goal reading 10000 in goalsV2 was 7500 in
# savingsGoals. Query savingsGoals; goalsV2 will quietly serve pre-migration
# numbers.
#
# The two also have separate ids for the same goal, which is why a transaction
# rule has both linkGoalAction and linkSavingsGoalAction and they are NOT
# interchangeable.

    Update a savings goal's target or monthly contribution.

    Unlike the transaction-rule mutation, this is a genuine partial update:
    omitted fields are preserved, verified against the live API. Pass only what
    you want to change.

    NOTE: the monthly contribution is not set here. `plannedMonthlyContribution`
    is a read-only rollup -- the input accepts it and reports success, but the
    value never persists. Contributions are budgeted per funding account; use
    `set_goal_contribution`.

    Args:
        goal_id: Goal to update. Use get_goals -- and note these are
            `savingsGoals` ids, which differ from the legacy goalsV2 ids.
        target_amount: Total amount the goal is aiming at.
        target_date: Target completion date, "YYYY-MM-DD". Optional on a goal.
        name: Rename the goal.
        priority: Ordering among goals, lower first.
        goal_type: Goal category, e.g. "emergency_fund", "retirement",
            "sinking_fund". Changes how Monarch treats the goal, so it is not
            merely a label.
        is_sinking_fund: Whether the goal is spent down and refilled rather
            than accumulated.

    Not exposed: the image fields (`imageStorageProvider` /
    `imageStorageProviderId`) are settable but purely cosmetic. Everything else
    on the input either is not accepted (`archivedAt`, `completedAt`, `icon`,
    `color`, `accountIds`) or does not persist (see the note above).
